					<b>Ghost Rhythm</b> is a working title for a game that unfortunately
					never saw the light of day. If it had finished, it would've been
					a DDR clone at first blush, but expand into a rhythmic bullet-hell
					as levels progressed and the mechanics and difficulty ramped up.
					</br></br>
					As you may have guessed, I don't have access to the game's art folder anymore.
					I hope you enjoy my improvised rendition!
				</p>
				<p class="block-text">
					<b>My contribution</b> was to provide the music. It was a real
					challenge to get the tone right, and multiple ideas were rejected before
					these versions were selected as two of the would-be level scores.
					</br>
					What made the music for this project unique was the blend of themes: highly
					rhythmic dance music meeting video game asthetics, ghosts ánd medeival fantasy.

					<b>ZORPON</b> was a weird little game made by a friend of mine. An unidentifyable
					entity has eluded you for the longest time, and in this game the goal is to play
					through several minigames to find the true identity of the all-mighty ZORPON—
					preferably without losing your mind!

					<b>My contribution</b> was the music for the 'sandcastle' level (below), and the
					'question' frame (top), as well as the main menu music, also heard in the trailer.</br></br> 
					In the question frame, you have the opportunity to fill
					in what you think ZORPON is. It's a slightly offputting, frightening space where
					all you can do is type in possible answers.</br>
					Contrarily, the sandcastle level is one of the calmer levels. You simply get to
					build a pretty sandcastle as the tide comes rolling in.

				<p class="block-text"><b>The Unbearable Well</b> is a weird gamejam game with a healthy helping of
				charm and a characteristic lack of polish. I'm still, years later, of the opinion that it had and has
				potential, but there's also some cringeworthy elements that are inevitable when you create a game in
				a mere 48 hours.</p>
				<p class="block-text"><b>My contribution</b> to the Unbearable Well is (a bit annoyingly) mostly in the
				character design and animations. What can I say- you do what you must in a gamejam. That said, though I
				didn't work on the sound design at all I had a big hand in the music. In fact, I made all of it, as a break
				of staring at an animated bear-butt.</p>

				<p class="block-text"><b>Bridge Game</b> is another student project which never saw the light of day. What was at
				some point a neat little puzzle-platformer doesn't even really run anymore, as it was never properly debugged and
				the build was never stable. I still like the style, even if that's all that's left.</p>
				<p class="block-text"><b>My contribution</b> was a relatively unique one: sound design! I rarely get to dip my toes
				into that particular pond, so it was really nice to get the opportunity. Some of these sounds don't quite hit me right
				nowadays, but for the most part I'm very happy with how this first level turned out.</p>
