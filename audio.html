					<b>Ghost Rhythm</b> is a working title for a game that unfortunately
					never saw the light of day. If it had finished, it would've been
					a DDR clone at first blush, but expand into a rhythmic bullet-hell
					as levels progressed and the mechanics and difficulty ramped up.
					</br></br>
					As you may have guessed, I don't have access to the game's art folder anymore.
					I hope you enjoy my improvised rendition!
				</p>
				<p class="block-text">
					I provided three tracks for GR. It was a real challenge to get the tone right, 
					and multiple ideas were rejected before
					these versions were selected as two of the would-be level scores.
					</br></br>
					What made the music for this project unique was the blend of themes: highly
					rhythmic dance music meeting video game asthetics, ghosts ánd medeival fantasy.

					<b>ZORPON</b> was a weird little game made by a friend of mine. An unidentifyable
					entity has eluded you for the longest time, and in this game the goal is to play
					through several minigames to find the true identity of the all-mighty ZORPON—
					preferably without losing your mind!
					</br></br>
					<a href="https://lordl75.itch.io/zorpon">Try ZORPON for yourself here!</a>
					</br></br>
					I provided three tracks for ZORPON: the 'sandcastle' level (right-side), the
					'question' theme (left-side), and the main menu music, which can be heard in the trailer.
				</p>
				<p class="block-text">
					In the question frame, you have the opportunity to fill
					in what you think ZORPON is. It's a slightly offputting, frightening space where
					all you can do is type in possible answers.</br>
					Contrarily, the sandcastle level is one of the calmer levels. You simply get to
					build a pretty sandcastle as the tide comes rolling in.

				<p class="block-text"><b>The Unbearable Well</b> is a weird gamejam game with a healthy helping of

				potential, but there's also some cringeworthy elements that are inevitable when you create a game in
				a mere 48 hours.</p>
				<p class="block-text">Due to Unbearable Well being a game jam game, most of my efforts were put into a less
				familiar discipline by simple neccesity:
				the character design and animations are almost entirely my doing, which is something you can see more of in my 'visuals' page. That said, I still had a big hand in the music. In fact, I made all of it, as a break
				of staring at an animated bear-butt.</p>

				<p class="block-text">This project was one of the few dedicated sound-design roles I enhabited. Some of these sounds don't quite hit me right nowadays, but for the most part I'm very happy with how this first level turned out.</p>

					<b>Cat & Mice</b> is the first(ish) in a series of pieces I've written
					over the years in collaboration with a bounty of highly profficient 
					instrumentalists. The collaboration has been facilitated through the HKU 
					(the college I attend) and each time I've been highly pleased with the 
					results. April 2024 will mark the finale of this series, with what 
					promises to be an explosive finale with the Zuilens Brass Orchestra.
					</br></br>
					Writing for solo cello was a daunting task. My first fear was the lack of
					options: what are you supposed to do with not just a single instrument, but
					a monophonic composition!?
				</p>
				<p class="block-text">
					As it turns out, there's lots you can do to make a piece such as this special.
					My challenge quickly transformed from a fear over lack of options, to an almost
					greedy desire to explore the bounds of what I could get a performer to achieve.
					The result is a long, varied piece of which I am still as proud as I could be of
					a single composition. </br>
					</br>
					My only regret is that I couldn't get myself to tone down the skill level just a 
					smidge, as the cellist had a very short time to practice. Still, I think he did an
					amazing job and I do quite enjoy 'hearing' him sweat throughout the performance.

				<p class="block-text">
					<b>Beast Awakening</b> was originally a school project— A technical challenge
					centering the concept of "modulation". This particular assignment ended up
					being a personal favorite composition of mine, however. I love escalation as 
					well as musical phrases that feel truly L A R G E and imposing. That combined
					with the fact that this piece is where I stopped worrying and learned to love 
					clarinet.
				</p>
				<p class="block-text">
					This was a very intuitive piece to write for me. It helped to have a clear 
					assignment, but I also chose and arrangement and musical structure that fit 
					the intensity with which I like to imbue my music. It took a couple of weeks 
					to complete, as the assignment was comprised of multiple sub-assignments, which 
					sort of forced me to pay attention to details I may have overlooked had I been 
					invited to rush it for a quick grade.

					<b>Flórianne's Canon</b> is a song I wrote for my sister. She's a year younger
					than me and though she never got into music the way I did, she used to play the 
					first two bars of this piece all the time sitting next to me behind the keyboard.
					When I started composing more seriously, she asked me to finish it, and I gladly 
					obliged!
				</p>
				<p class="block-text">
					There was no pressure on this piece, which really helped me find my flow in a genre 
					that's a little bit out of my ballpark. I tend to write my classical music with a very 
					contemporary mindset, but this was a fairly straight-forward classical canon. I just wanted
					to make sure those original two bars really shaped the rest of the song, and I think that 
					worked out great!
