					Javascript (with the p5 graphics library installed) was one of my first experiences with coding, and it's been a bit nostalgic to pick it back up the past year or two, after taking some time to teach myself python, c#, gdscript and the like. I'm still learning about CSS/HTML. In fact, it's a daily struggle to suppress the urge to just start over and "do it right this time!" They're slowly clicking for me, though, and the urge to continually update is only caused by the knowledge that my skills now really are greater than they were yesterday.
					</br></br>
					There's nothing wrong with using squarespace or some other similar platform, obviously. It's just that I grow faster when I constantly search out new challenges. Plus, there's a sense of pride for me in doing it the way it's "supposed" to be done; no shortcuts. I'm not sure that's <i>always</i> a helpful attitude, but in this case I'm glad I took the route I did for all I learned in the process.

				I created the concept for Alone in about 2 days, then shelved it as I had more pressing matters to attend to. Only recently did I pick it back up and finish it as part of the research I did for my thesis (linked below, if you're interested.)
				</br></br>
				Among other things, this was the first time I designed a save/load system, which was kind of fun and tricky. Obviously just pushing a dict to a file and retrieiving it isn't super challenging, but making that process as efficient as I could with no experience in this area was a nice way to explore how these things are usually done.
				</br></br>
				The idea first came about when a friendship ended rather abruptly. It made me feel kind of paralyzed, like I had fewer ways to move around in the world... The end result is quite cheerful when put next to the title, but I think the way the music adapts helps to get the tone to where I wanted it.
