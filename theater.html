					<b>LIMBUS</b> was part of a cooperation with theater students at the Glasgow Royal Conservatoire.
					The protagonist experiences multiple steps in the story that leads to her eventual great sin, fall
					from grace, and damnation. Limbus is a thrilling, personal, sometimes uncomfortably close piece which
					is, of course, best experienced in person.
					</br>
					By the time the music was to be added to
					Limbus, the script was already finalized and there was a clear idea on the direction the writers and 
					actors had in mind. Luckily, the music team was given a loose leash to play by, which gave us the opportunity to make our part of the play into something special.
				</p>
				<p class="block-text">
					I played non of the music, but composed most of it. A big part, however, was going into 
					the studio with a group of talented musicians and 'finding' the composition as we went. I played a big part 
					in directing this group as well as directing the Glasgow students once we arrived on location, helping them
					find queues in the music that would allow them to synchronize their play to it.
					</br></br>
					I didn't manage to reach the people working with me, but once I get a hold of them I'll be adding links to their
					socials/websites. This was obviously an incredibly cooperative project.

				<p class="block-text"><b>01011000</b> is a mouthful. But also: 01011000 is a play about gender, and 
					living in a world where your gender identity is seen as both a trivial concern <i>and</i> a threat to
					the status quo. The crew is almost entirely comprised of trans and gender-non-conforming people, lending 
					a credible sense of frustration and loss to the writing, performances, direction and- of course- music.
				</p>
				<p class="block-text">I treated this project in a somewhat impersonal way.
					Strange, considering the subject matter, but as the play was being prepared during a busy period in my life
					I felt it best to create my music seperately and then visit every so often to get a sense for how it fit and what needed to be changed. In the end this turned out to be the first play I helped to make which I actually cried over. This subject hits home for me, as a trans woman, and seeing my music grant such power to words written by other people who experienced and overcame similar prejudices was very moving.

					<b>KASKO</b> was quite likely my strangest, yet most enjoyable artistic experiences.
					In a single week, four teams comprised of some 8 music- and musical theater students
					put together performances in 4 different spaces in a church, with the consent of the
					building's owners. We lived together in a little vacation home we all rented together
					and worked from the early morning until evening. In the end, we created some fabulous
					performances which unfortunately were fotographed more than they were filmed.

				<b>My first performance</b> of the evening, and the first performance in general, took place in a
				small, musty room, which we quickly decided to treat as a sort of 'bar'-set. This combined
				with the musical genre we had generated- a combination of dubstep, a french chanson and references
				to vampirism. I've included two clips, seen below. 
				</br></br>
				If you're looking for me (as well you should,) I'm the pile of laundry behind the piano. There's
				two more pictures of that look at the top of this section.

					<b>My second performance</b> of the evening is also the final one I can do any justice here.
					Combining a metal table, two ornate wine-glasses, me and my co-creator Amber portrayed a sort
					of summoning ritual, centering themes of change and reflection. Amber is a ballet dancer and 
					opera-singer, something she baffellingly managed to combine in this piece.
					What I liked best about our performance was how understated it really ended up being. I created
					watery effects on the ceiling with a phone-torch and a water bottle, as I combined the metal
					table and the wine-glasses to create some odd resonances. Amber would then interrupt me, culminating
					in an encounter where we approached eachother as she sang and danced, and I continued to create all
					sorts of noises with the water. In the end, she took my original place by the table, looking up
					at the ceiling, whilst I slipped out the back and ran to the next room for my third performance.
