I'm trying to find a formula that'll let me know wether a given boid is on the right side of a line.

What I need to know is:
The x and y position of that boid
1st point on line
2nd point on line

What I need to use is:
A formula which draws the line 


What we want to do is the following:
if (formula(x position) > y position) {
	dodge one way
} else {
	dodge the other way
}

------------------------------------------||
A straight line follows this formula:
y = ax + b

y: height
x: time
a: steepness of line
b: origin of line (y at x = 0)

we can find a using this formula:
a = deltaY/deltaX
or in other words
a = (y2-y1)/(x2-x1)

We divide the difference in y by how long it took to get to that y.
We do need to points along the line for this to work.

so our formula becomes:
y3 <? ((y2-y1)/(x2-x1))x3 + b

where
[x1,y1] = point1 on line
[x2,y2] = point2 on line
[x3,y3] = point to test (is it under the line?)
b = height of origin

and I'm fairly certain to figure out wether x3 is within range you do the same thing but the other way arounnd:
x3 <? ((y2-y1)/(x2-x1))y3 + b

although in this case b = the horizontal offset at y = 0

It works, I'm officially a genius!
