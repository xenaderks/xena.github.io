						<b>Ghost Rhythm</b> is a working title for a game that unfortunately
						never saw the light of day. If it had finished, it would've been
						a DDR clone at first blush, but expand into a rhythmic bullet-hell
						as levels progressed and the mechanics and difficulty ramped up.
						</br></br>
						As you may have guessed, I don't have access to the game's art folder anymore.
						I hope you enjoy my improvised rendition!
					</p>
					<p class="block-text">
						It was a real challenge to get the tone right, and multiple ideas were
						rejected beforethese versions were selected as two of the would-be level scores.
						</br>
						What made the music for this project unique was the blend of themes: highly
						rhythmic dance music meeting video game asthetics, ghosts and medeival fantasy.
