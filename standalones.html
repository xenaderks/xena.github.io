					<b>Cat & Mice</b> is the first(ish) in a series of pieces I've written
					over the years in collaboration with a bounty of highly profficient 
					instrumentalists. The collaboration has been facilitated through the HKU 
					(the college I attend) and each time I've been highly pleased with the 
					results. April 2024 will mark the finale of this series, with what 
					promises to be an explosive finale with the Zuilens Brass Orchestra.

					Writing for solo cello was a daunting task. My first fear was the lack of
					options: what are you supposed to do with not just a single instrument, but
					a monophonic composition!? </br>
					</br>
					As it turns out, there's lots you can do to make a piece such as this special.
					My challenge quickly transformed from a fear over lack of options, to an almost
					greedy desire to explore the bounds of what I could get a performer to achieve.
					The result is a long, varied piece of which I am still as proud as I could be of
					a single composition. </br>
					</br>
					My only regret is that I couldn't get myself to tone down the skill level just a 
					smidge, as the cellist had a very short time to practice. Still, I think he did an
					amazing job and I do quite enjoy 'hearing' him sweat throughout the performance.

					<b>Beast Awakening</b> was originally a school project— A technical challenge
					centering the concept of "modulation". This particular assignment ended up
					being a personal favorite composition of mine, however. I love escalation as 
					well as musical phrases that feel truly L A R G E and imposing. That combined
					with the fact that this piece is where I stopped worrying and learned to love 
					clarinet.
				</p>
				<p class="block-text">
					This was a very intuitive piece to write for me. It helped to have a clear 
					assignment, but I also chose and arrangement and musical structure that fit 
					the intensity with which I like to imbue my music. It took a couple of weeks 
					to complete, as the assignment was comprised of multiple sub-assignments, which 
					sort of forced me to pay attention to details I may have overlooked had I been 
					invited to rush it for a quick grade.

					<b>Flórianne's Canon</b> is a song I wrote for my sister. She's a year younger
					than me and though she never got into music the way I did, she used to play the 
					first two bars of this piece all the time sitting next to me behind the keyboard.
					When I started composing more seriously, she asked me to finish it, and I gladly 
					obliged!
				</p>
				<p class="block-text">
					There was no pressure on this piece, which really helped me find my flow in a genre 
					that's a little bit out of my ballpark. I tend to write my classical music with a very 
					contemporary mindset, but this was a fairly straight-forward classical canon. I just wanted
					to make sure those original two bars really shaped the rest of the song, and I think that 
					worked out great!
